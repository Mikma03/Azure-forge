# Chapter 10 - Understanding model results

In this chapter you will learn how to analyse the results of your machine learning models to be able to interpret why the model made the inference it did. Understanding why the model predicted a value is key to avoid black box model deployments and to be able to understand the limitation your model may have. In this chapter you will understand the available interpretation features of AzureML and visualize the model explanation results. You will also learn how to analyse potential model errors and detect cohorts where the model is performing poorly. Finally, you are going to explore tools that help you assess your modelâ€™s fairness and allow you to mitigate potential issues.
