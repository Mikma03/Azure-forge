# Chapter 9 - Optimizing the ML model

In this chapter you will learn about two techniques you can use to discover the optimal model for your dataset. You will start by exploring the HyperDrive package of the AzureML SDK. This package allows you to fine tune modelâ€™s performance by tweaking the parameters it exposes, a process also known as hyperparameter tuning. You will then explore the Automated ML package of the AzureML SDK which allows you to automate the model selection, training and optimization process through code.
