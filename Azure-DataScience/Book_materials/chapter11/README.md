# Chapter 11 - Working with pipelines

In this chapter you will understand how you can author repeatable processes defining pipelines that consist of multiple steps. You can use these pipelines to author training pipelines that transform your data and then train models, or you can use them to perform batch inferences using pretrained models. Once you register one of those pipelines, you can invoke it using an HTTP endpoint, through the SDK or even configure them to execute on a schedule.
